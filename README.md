# Course-Simulation-Game

This is a text-based adventure game written in `Clojure` that simulates taking the class CS225 at UIUC, which is one of the best CS courses I have taken so far. 

To play the game: 
1. Download the project and open up your terminal
2. Change your directory to this directory`Course-Simulation-Game`.
3. Run `lein run` (You might need to install clojure environment)
4. You are in the game! Have fun!

Feel free to reach out for anything!
