# CS225-Simulation-Game

This is a text-based adventure game written in `Clojure` that simulates taking the class CS225 at UIUC, which is one of the best CS courses I have taken so far. 

To play the game: 
1. Change your directory to `adventure/src/adventure`.
2. Run `lein repl` (You might need to install clojure environment)
3. Run `(-main)`
4. You are in the game! Have fun!

Feel free to reach out for anything!
